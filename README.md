## Database Design

### Data Model

The data for the FriendFinder application is stored in a Google Sheet using the gspread library. The sheet is structured with the following column headings: "Name", "Phone", "Email", and "Notes". Each contact is stored in a single row, with one row representing one contact.

When the application runs, it interacts directly with the Google Sheet to read and write contact data. The rows are typically retrieved as lists, and each contact is represented as a list of values corresponding to the sheet’s columns. For example:

["John Doe", "1234567890", "john@example.com", "Work colleague"]

All operations—such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts—are performed using functions that manipulate these lists and synchronize changes back to the Google Sheet.
There is no dedicated Contact class; instead, the logic is function-based. Each function handles a specific task like inserting a new row, finding a row by name, or modifying existing contact data.
This data model ensures simplicity and flexibility while allowing the application to persist data between sessions through the cloud-based Google Sheet.


#### Classes & Functions

The primary functions used in this application are:

- `add_contact()`
    - Prompts the user for contact details and saves them to the Google Sheet.
- `view_contacts()`
    - Retrieves and displays all saved contacts, sorted alphabetically by name.
- `search_contact()`
    - Searches for a contact by name and displays the result.
- `edit_contact()`
    - Finds a contact by name and allows the user to update the contact's details.
- `delete_contact()`
    - Finds a contact by name and removes it from the Google Sheet.
- `print_menu()`
    - Displays the main menu options.
- `main()`
    - Runs the program loop and handles user menu input.

#### Imports

I've used the following Python packages and external imports:

- `gspread`: used to connect and interact with Google Sheets
- `google.oauth2.service_account`: used for authenticating Google Sheets API credentials
- `colorama`: used for adding color to terminal outputs for better readability


## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/allaafaham/friend-finder/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/allaafaham/friend-finder/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser. This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://friend-finder-py-77390a27fd18.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of **KEY** to `PORT`, and the **VALUE** to `8000` then select **ADD**.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as **CREDS.JSON**, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important; select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The Python terminal window should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Google Sheets API

This application uses [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) to handle a "makeshift" database on the live site.

To run your own version of this application, you will need to create your own Google Sheet with one sheet named `Sheet1` (or leave the default name) in the following format:

| Name         | Phone       | Email               | Notes         |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| John Doe     | 1234567890  | john@example.com    | Work contact  |
| Jane Smith   | 0987654321  | jane@example.com    | Family        |
| Sample Name  | 5551234567  | sample@email.com    | Gym buddy     |


A credentials file in `.JSON` format from the Google Cloud Platform is also mandatory:

[Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com)

1. From the dashboard click on "Select a project", and then the **NEW PROJECT** button.
2. Give the project a name, and then click **CREATE**.
3. Click **SELECT PROJECT** to get to the project page.
4. From the side-menu, select "APIs & Services", then select "Library".
5. Search for the "Google Drive API", select it, and then click on **ENABLE**.
6. Click on the **CREATE CREDENTIALS** button.
7. From the "Which API are you using?" dropdown menu, choose **Google Drive API**.
8. For the "What data will you be accessing?" question, select **Application Data**.
9. Click **Next**.
10. Enter a "Service Account" name, then click **Create**.
11. In the "Role" dropdown box, choose "Basic" > "Editor", then press **Continue**.
12. "Grant users access to this service account" can be left blank. Click **DONE**.
13. On the next page, click on the "Service Account" that has been created.
14. On the next page, click on the "Keys" tab.
15. Click on the "Add Key" dropdown, and select "Create New Key".
16. Select `JSON`, and then click **Create**. This will trigger the `.json` file with your API credentials in it to download to your machine locally.
17. For local deployment, this needs to be renamed to `creds.json`.
18. Repeat steps 4 & 5 above to add the "Google Sheets API".
19. Copy the `client_email` that is in the `creds.json` file.
20. Share your Google Sheet to the `client_email`, ensuring "Editing" is enabled.
21. Add the `creds.json` file to your `.gitignore` file, so as not to push your credentials to GitHub publicly.
